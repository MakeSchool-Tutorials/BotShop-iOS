# Project Setup 


# Using Git/GitHub

As you go through this tutorial, you will also be making commits after completing milestones. This is a requirement, you must make a commit whenever the tutorial prompts you. This not only further enforces best practices for software engineering, but also will help you more easily figure out where a bug originated from if you break your progress up into discrete, trackable chunks.

When prompted to commit, you'll see a sample commit message. Feel free to use your own message, so long as it clearly and concisely covers the work done.

Lastly, the commit prompts in this tutorial should be the minimum amount of times you commit. If you want to do more commits, breaking your chunks into even smaller chunks, that is totally fine!


```

# Git Setup

```
# Set Up Git/GitHub

Set up your repo!

>[action]
> Make your first commit
>
\```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'project init'
\```

Now Go to GitHub and create a public repository called Bot-Shop, and now associate it as a remote for your local git project and then push to it.

>[action]
> Push it!
>
\```bash
$ git remote add origin GITHUB-REPO-URL
$ git push origin master -u
\```
