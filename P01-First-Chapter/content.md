# Why Is This Important
Programmatic Swift iOS applications are an industry standard and tabbar navigation is 


Use this section to concisely covey to students why this topic is important for them to learn. This should be tied to industry examples, or fundamentals of the course. Try to keep this brief, and possibly include an action block asking them to think of examples they see of this in industry.

# User Stories

User stories is a tool used in agile software development to capture a feature or task from the users perspective. 

```
# User Stories

1. As a buyer, I want to see available microbots so that I can purchase the one I need 
2. As a buyer, I want to see previous orders of microbots so that I can remember which ones I like and do not like 
3. As a buyer, I want to be able to favorite the microbots I like so that I can easily find them next time
