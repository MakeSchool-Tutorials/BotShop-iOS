# Overview

It’s the year 3000 and the everyday person is now 75% machine and requires the services of microbots for inner bodily maintenance. It’s your job to create an app that enables people to order the bots they need. 

As the only iOS developer capable for such an important task, you will have the best equipment and tools availble to you to create a 100% programmatic native iOS app using Swift and Xcode. 

# Why Is This Important
Aside from saving billions of people by giving them access to the microbots they need; programmatic Swift iOS applications are an industry standard that allow for more speed, power, and control in the mobile development process. In hand with programmatic iOS development, tab bars are a handy tool that enable users to navigate apps.

> Can you think of 3 different mobile apps that use tab bars as their source for in-app navigation? What are some things that all those tab bars have in common? Are there any differences?


# Who Is This For? 
iOS beginners who already have some experience with Xcode and are familiar with coding in Swift.

**What You Should Already Know**

You should know how to:

- navigate your way around Xcode
- differentiate between table views and collection views
- organize your code using MVC

Resources can include (but are not limited to):

- Completion of MOB 1.1 
- Strong understanding of Swift 

**Estimated Completion Time:**

4 hours

# Learning Outcomes

```
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to...

1. Create an iOS application programmatically using agile development
2. Setup navigation in the app using tabbar 
3. Create tableviews and collectionviews 
4. Implement custom fonts and custom tabbar icons 
5. Have a better understanding of stacks

# User Stories
User stories is a tool used in agile software development to capture a feature or task from the users perspective. 

```
1. As a buyer, I want to see available microbots so that I can purchase the one I need 
2. As a buyer, I want to see previous orders of microbots so that I can remember which ones I like and do not like 
3. As a buyer, I want to be able to favorite the microbots I like so that I can easily find them next time 
```

# If You Get Stuck
Getting stuck when coding (and debugging) is a natural part of the programming process. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or lost, feel free to take a break, get some water, take a walk, and come back with a fresh mind. Then retrace your steps in the tutorial. Make sure you've follow each step of the tutorial. It's easy to make typos or to accidentally skip over important steps.
