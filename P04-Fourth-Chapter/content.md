# About Agile Development 
As you go about your technical journey, you’ll hear the term Agile Development tossed around a lot! But what is it exactly? 

**Agile development** is an approach to software development that continuously delivers working software. At Make School, we talk about agile development being first developing a skateboard, then a car, and then ultimately a rocketship. 

If you haven’t heard these terms tossed around yet then it might be beneficial for you to pay attention to the diagram and description of each stage.

When starting a project a lot of people first imagine what their ultimate end-goal project will look like and immediately start brainstorming of a bunch of cool features they can implement. The problem with starting off trying to develop their dream product right off the bat is that it can take a long time before the final product is shipped. 

This is where agile development comes in: each iteration (the skateboard, the bike, and so on) are all shippable at that stage. The skateboard is the MVP (minimal viable product) of the bigger product (ie the rocket), it has at most 3 built out features. 

## Why Would We Do This? 
Working with agile development helps with over scoping (taking on more than you can handle in a project), prioritizing, and saves you a lot of time ensuring that you end up with a product that people will actually use. Typically, the sooner you can get a project to production, the sooner you can get data and feedback from your user base which can help determine what your next steps should be. Instead of you going off on a limb and possibly wasting time developing something people aren't interested in. 

# Incorporating Agile Development into Bot Shop 

We'll get back to the project soon. And when we do, we will be incorporating agile development by setting up all the pages all at once and building out the navigation. 

That might sound intimidating at first but what we'll be doing is just having more colored pages like we did for the red screen last chapter. We simply just want to build things out for the sole purpose to make sure they exist and that we're able to navigate between the screens. From there, we will build upon our project layer by layer until you have a functional app. 

Excited? Let's get to it!
